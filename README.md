# InDels-from-MSA
Detection of InDels from Multiple Sequence Alignment 
A simple python script to extract InDels from a multiple sequnce alignment of thirteen sequecnes (in this particular case). 
Output will be the position of InDels, followed by bases present in that position of aligned sequences. 
P.S: Change the script acording to number of sequences in MSA.
